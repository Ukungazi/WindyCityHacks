            <h5>Lesson 1: What Is Computer Literacy?</h5>
            <p><b>Definition</b></p>
            <p>Computer literacy refers to the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, encompassing a range of skills from basic use to advanced problem-solving. It includes understanding how to operate a computer, navigate the internet, and use various software applications such as email clients. Beyond these basics, computer literacy also involves knowing how to stay safe online, manage digital information, and leverage technology to enhance productivity and communication. In today's digital age, being computer literate is essential for personal, educational, and professional success, as it empowers individuals to access information, connect with others, and perform tasks more effectively.
            </p>
            <p><b>Basic Terminology</b></p>
            <p><u>Hardware</u></p>
            <p>Think of a computer like a car. Just as a car is made up of different parts that help it run, a computer has several key components called "hardware" that make it work. The monitor, or screen, is like the car's windshield, allowing you to see what's happening by displaying everything you do. The keyboard is similar to the steering wheel, letting you control the computer by typing in words and numbers. The mouse functions like the car's gear shift, helping you navigate and select items on the screen. Inside the computer, there are more parts, like the engine in a car, such as the processor (CPU) which does the thinking, and the memory (RAM) which helps the computer remember what it's doing. All these hardware components work together to make the computer function smoothly, just like the parts of a car work together to get you where you need to go.</p>
            <p><u>Software</u></p>
            <p>Software is like a set of instructions that tell a computer or a device what to do. It's a bit like a recipe book for your gadgets. Just as a recipe guides you step-by-step to cook a meal, software guides your computer to perform tasks, like browsing the internet, sending messages, or playing games. Different types of software help with different things, whether it's organizing photos, writing documents, or even helping doctors keep track of patients. So, think of software as the brains behind all the amazing things your gadgets can do.
            </p>
            <p><u>Operating Systems</u></p>
            <p>An operating system is in charge of making sure all the different parts of your computer, like the screen, keyboard, and mouse, can work together smoothly. It also helps you run programs, which are like tools or appliances in the building. For example, if you want to write a letter or play a game, the operating system helps you open the right program and use it. Different computers might have different operating systems, like Windows, macOS, or Linux, but they all do similar jobs of making your computer easy to use.

                  <h5>Lesson 2: Basic Computer Operations</h5>
                  <p><b>Starting a Computer</b></p>
                  <p>To start your computer, first find the power button. It's usually a small button on the front or side of your computer with this symbol on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>**insert image of power symbol</p>
                  <p> Press it once, and you'll hear a noise and see lights come on. After a moment, the computer screen will light up, showing you a picture or some words. That means it's starting up!
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Shutting Down a Computer</b></p>
                  <p>To shut off your computer when you're done using it, you'll need to click on the "Start" button (it's often in the lower left corner of your screen), then click on "Shutdown" or "Turn off." It will ask you if you're sure you want to turn off your computer. Click "Yes" or "OK," and your computer will go through a process of closing everything it's doing and then turn off. It's a bit like putting your book away after you've finished readingâ€”it's ready for a rest until you want to use it again!
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Using the Keyboard</b></p>
                  <p>Using a keyboard is basically just pressing buttons to write words and give commands to your computer. Each key represents a letter, number, or symbol. To write a word, you simply press the keys one at a time, and the characters will appear on the screen where the cursor is. The spacebar, which is the long key at the bottom, creates spaces between words. There are also special keys like the "Enter" key, which moves the cursor to the next line or tells the computer to complete a command, and the "Backspace" key, which deletes the last character you typed. With a bit of practice, using a keyboard becomes second nature, making it easy to write emails, search the internet, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Using the Mouse</b></p>
                  <p>Using a mouse is like using a remote control to point and click on things you see on the computer screen. The mouse is a small device that you move with your hand. When you move the mouse on the table, a pointer (usually an arrow) moves on the screen in the same direction. To select something, you point the arrow at it and press the left button on the mouse. This is called clicking. For some actions, you might need to double-click, which means pressing the left button twice quickly. The right button on the mouse often opens a menu with more options when you click it. There's also a scroll wheel in the middle of the mouse, which you can roll up or down to move the screen view up or down. With practice, using a mouse makes it easy to navigate and interact with your computer.

                        <p><b>What is the Internet?</b></p>
                        <p>The internet connects millions of computers all over the world, allowing people to share information and communicate with each other. When you're on the internet, you can look up almost anything, just like browsing through books in a library. You can read news, watch videos, send emails, talk to friends and family, and even do your shopping. Websites are like pages in this giant library, and you use a program called a web browser to visit these pages. So, the internet is a vast network of information and services that you can access anytime from your computer, tablet, or smartphone.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>How to Use a Web Browser</b></p>
                        <p>Web browsers are your window into the internet. To get started, find and double-click the browser icon on your desktop or in the Start menu; common ones include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Once the browser is open, you'll see a long box at the top called the address bar. Click inside it, type in a website address like www.google.com, and press the "Enter" key on your keyboard. If you don't know the exact address, you can type in keywords or questions, and the browser will show you search results to help you find what you're looking for. From there, you can click on links to explore different websites, read articles, watch videos, and much more.
