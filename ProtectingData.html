            <h5>Lesson 1: Passwords and Two Factor Authentication</h5>
            <p><b>Importance of Strong Passwords</b></p>
            <p>Strong passwords are like strong locks on your doors—they keep your personal information safe. Just like you wouldn't use a flimsy lock on your front door, you shouldn't use easy-to-guess passwords for your online accounts. Weak passwords, like "123456" or "password," are easy for hackers to figure out. Once they have your password, they can get into your accounts, steal your personal information, and even commit fraud using your identity. By using strong passwords that combine letters, numbers, and special characters, you make it much harder for anyone to guess them, keeping your information and online activities secure.
            </p>
            <p><b>How to Create a Strong Password</b></p>
            <p>So what makes a password “strong”? Some websites will not let you create a password unless they deem it strong by their own terms. However, a really strong password should always consist of these elements:
            </p>
            <p><u>At least 12 characters.</u></p>
            <p>A long password is harder to guess. The longer your password the better, but a general rule of thumb is having a minimum of 12 characters. 
            </p>
            <p><u>A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</u></p>
            <p>Doing this will increase your password’s complexity and reduce the risk of it being easily guessed or cracked. This mix of characters creates many more possible combinations, making your password much stronger and your accounts more secure.
            </p>
            <p><u>Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization.
            </u></p>
            <p>Hackers will usually try going for passwords that are common words first. By making sure your password is as unique as possible, you heavily reduce the risk of getting your data breached.
            </p>
            <p><u>Significantly different from your previous passwords.
            </u></p>
            <p>In the case that one of your passwords gets compromised, you don’t want all of your passwords to be known. Having unique passwords for different websites is the best form of damage control in the event of getting hacked. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Password Managers</b></p>
            <p>A password manager is like a secure digital notebook that stores all your passwords in one place, so you don't have to remember them all. You only need to remember one master password to access the password manager, and it will automatically fill in your passwords for you when you need them, keeping your accounts safe and making your life easier.
            </p>
            <p><b>What is Two-Factor Authentication></p></b>
            <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. After you enter your password, 2FA requires a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. This additional step ensures that only you can access your account, even if someone else knows your password.
            </p>
            <p><b>How to Set Up Two Factor Authentication on Various Accounts</b></p>
            <p>To set up two-factor authentication (2FA) on various accounts, you generally need to go to the security settings of the account. For example, in your Google Account, sign in, navigate to the "Security" section, and click on "2-Step Verification" to get started. Follow the prompts, which usually involve entering your phone number to receive a verification code. Similarly, on social media accounts like Facebook or Twitter, go to the security settings, find the 2FA option, and follow the instructions to set it up using your phone number or an authentication app. This process typically involves receiving a code via text message or an app, which you then enter to complete the setup.

                  <h5>Lesson 2: Safe Browsing Practices</h5>
                  <p><b>Secure Websites and HTTPS</b></p>
                  <p>Secure websites and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) ensure that your information is protected when you browse the internet. When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, the data exchanged between your browser and the website is encrypted. This encryption makes it difficult for anyone else to intercept and read the information, such as your login credentials or credit card details, while it's being transmitted. You can identify a secure website by looking for "https://" at the beginning of the website address in your browser's address bar, along with a padlock symbol. These indicators reassure you that the website is taking steps to keep your personal information safe from unauthorized access.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Recognizing Fake Websites and URLs</b></p>
                  <p>Recognizing fake websites and URLs is very important when it comes to staying safe online. One of the first things to check is the website's URL in the address bar of your browser. Look for any misspellings or slight variations from the legitimate website's URL, as scammers often create deceptive URLs to mimic trusted sites. Additionally, ensure the website uses HTTPS encryption, indicated by a padlock icon and "https://" at the beginning of the URL, which helps protect your personal information. Be cautious of links in emails or messages that ask for sensitive information or redirect you to unfamiliar websites. It's always wise to verify the legitimacy of a website by checking reviews, contacting the company directly through trusted channels, or using search engines to confirm its authenticity before entering any personal details. Trusting your instincts and being vigilant can go a long way in avoiding scams and safeguarding your online security.
                  <p>
                  <p><b>Using Browser Security Features</b></p>
                  <p>Using browser security features involves taking advantage of built-in tools and settings to enhance your online safety while browsing the internet. These features include a pop-up blocker to prevent intrusive windows, phishing and malware protection that alerts you to potentially harmful websites, and privacy settings to manage how much information websites can access about you. Keeping your browser updated automatically installs security patches to address vulnerabilities, further safeguarding your browsing experience against emerging threats. By using these features, you can browse the web with greater peace of mind, knowing that your personal information and online activities are better protected.

                        <p><b>What is Personal Data?</b></p>
                        <p>Personal data in this context refers to information about you that could be used to identify you or learn more about you. This includes things like your name, address, phone number, email address, and even more sensitive information like your social security number or credit card details. In the digital world, personal data is valuable and can be targeted by cybercriminals who might try to steal it for fraudulent purposes, such as identity theft or financial scams. Protecting your personal data means being cautious about where you share it online, using strong passwords and security measures on your devices, and being aware of potential risks when interacting with websites or emails that ask for personal information. By keeping your personal data secure, you reduce the chances of becoming a victim of cybercrime and can browse the internet more safely.
