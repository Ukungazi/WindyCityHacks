            <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
            <img src="./Images/socialengineering.jpg">
            <p>Social engineering is a technique used by scammers to try and use people's morals.
               Social engineering can come in many forms, but the technique relies on scammers acting like they are someone in a desperate situation. 
               For example a scammer may call an insurance company acting like they are in danger to try and get private information regarding one of the companyâ€™s clients. 
               As such you should be wary of any calls and emails with someone you don't know acting desperate as oftentimes it is a scam attempt using social engineering. 
               Social engineering is easy to avoid when identified as you are typically able to ignore the email or leave the call. 
               However, if the scam isn't identified it is very easy for people to become morally attached and get scammed.

              <p>Some text..</p>
              <p>Phishing is a type of scam where a scammer impersonates someone else or a company in an effort to have you enter personal information like credit card information, website login information, and other sensitive personal information. 
                Typically phishing involves emails and messages involving fake links. For example an email may be sent impersonating the Chase bank with a url that is: www.credltcards.chase.com. 
                Seems real right? 
                The actual website for Chase is: www.creditcards.chase.com. 
                In the urls there is a difference of one letter, but that one wrong letter can send you to a fake website instead of the actual one. 
                In this fake website scammers are able to track everything you type and even where your mouse moves. Many people fall for these websites and enter their real bank information, which the scammers record. 
                With the information the scammers gained they are able to go to the real Chase website and login to the victims actual account.
                
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) outlines several signs of phishing:

Spelling and grammar mistakes. Official communications rarely have errors, so typos can be a red flag.

Urgency claims. Scammers often create a sense of urgency, pressuring the recipient to act quickly.

Suspicious links. Hover over links (without clicking) to see if the address looks legitimate.

Requests for personal information. Legitimate organizations usually do not ask for sensitive information via email, so be wary of any messages that do.

Here are some ways to avoid phishing: 

Verify the source. If in doubt, contact the organization the message sender claims to be representing directly through its official channels and websites. Do this using a separate search of your own, not through the contact information provided in a suspicious message.


Use security software. Installing and maintaining updated security software can provide an additional layer of protection against phishing attacks.

Enter a fake name and email and take the phishing test at "https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/" to test your ability to recognize phishing scams

                  <p>Some text..</p>
                  <p>Vishing, short for voice phishing, refers to fraudulent phone calls or voice messages designed to trick victims into providing sensitive information, like login credentials, credit card numbers, or bank details.
                     These details can then be exploited for criminal activities such as fraud, identity theft, or financial theft. 
                     Sadly Vishing attempts are very hard to identify due to the fact that the attempt tries to play at your moral compass through using social engineering. 
                     However to try and identify Vishing attempts you should be wary of any calls when the caller is unknown and they sound desperate. 
                     Ask for the person on the phone to provide private information they know back to you first. 
                     (Ex: someone asking for bank credentials should be able to tell you the correct reported address)

                      <p>Malware is a general term for harmful software code. Malware works by being installed on a device, typically disguised as a legitimate program. 
                        Once this malware is installed it has the potential to do anything on your computer such as shutting down your computer and tracking what you type.
                        Malware is a very general term for  harmful programs. Here are some specific types of malware and what they do:

Computer Virus: Specifically, a virus is malicious code that hijacks legitimate software to do damage and spread copies of itself. 
Viruses can't act on their own. 
Instead, they hide snippets of their code in other executable programs. 
When a user starts the program, the virus begins running, too. 
Viruses are usually designed to delete important data, disrupt normal operations, and spread copies of themselves to other programs on the infected computer.

Ransomware: Ransomware locks up a victim's devices or data and demands a ransom payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, to unlock them. 
The most basic ransomware attacks render assets unusable until the ransom is paid, but cybercriminals may use additional tactics to increase the pressure on victims.

Other malware: There are many other different types of malware that have various harmful effects on your device(s).
 You can learn more about these other types of malware by visiting the website.
