      <h2>Digital Literacy</h2>
      <div></div>
      <p>As the role technology plays in our everyday lives continues to grow, so does the issue of digital literacy. Digital literacy, or a person's ability to efficiently and safely utilize various technologies, is a necessary skill in today's world. A lack of digital literacy can create barriers to various opportunities, like online classes or job postings. Importantly, a lack of digital literacy makes one susceptible to scams and stolen personal information, putting money and safety at risk. </p>
      <p>The issue of digital illiteracy disproportionately impacts the elderly, minorities, and low-income individuals. However, this digital divide can be ameliorated by initiatives that are made accessible to these demographics.<p>
      <p>Our mission is to prevent as much digital crime as possible and promote a safer environment for all. Our site is intended to teach the basics of digital literacy, including basic termonology, scam prevention, and data protection, in a simplistic and engaging manner, making it easy to use and accessible to underrepresented demographics. <p>
