            <h5>Lesson 2: What Is Computer Literacy?</h5>
            <p><b>Definition</b></p>
            <p>Computer literacy refers to the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, encompassing a range of skills from basic use to advanced problem-solving. It includes understanding how to operate a computer, navigate the internet, and use various software applications such as email clients. Beyond these basics, computer literacy also involves knowing how to stay safe online, manage digital information, and leverage technology to enhance productivity and communication. In today's digital age, being computer literate is essential for personal, educational, and professional success, as it empowers individuals to access information, connect with others, and perform tasks more effectively.
            </p>
            <p><b>Basic Terminology</b></p>
            <p><u>Hardware</u></p>
            <p>Think of a computer like a car. Just as a car is made up of different parts that help it run, a computer has several key components called "hardware" that make it work. The monitor, or screen, is like the car's windshield, allowing you to see what's happening by displaying everything you do. The keyboard is similar to the steering wheel, letting you control the computer by typing in words and numbers. The mouse functions like the car's gear shift, helping you navigate and select items on the screen. Inside the computer, there are more parts, like the engine in a car, such as the processor (CPU) which does the thinking, and the memory (RAM) which helps the computer remember what it's doing. All these hardware components work together to make the computer function smoothly, just like the parts of a car work together to get you where you need to go.</p>
            <p><u>Software</u></p>
            <p>Software is like a set of instructions that tell a computer or a device what to do. It's a bit like a recipe book for your gadgets. Just as a recipe guides you step-by-step to cook a meal, software guides your computer to perform tasks, like browsing the internet, sending messages, or playing games. Different types of software help with different things, whether it's organizing photos, writing documents, or even helping doctors keep track of patients. So, think of software as the brains behind all the amazing things your gadgets can do.
            </p>
            <p><u>Operating Systems</u></p>
            <p>An operating system is in charge of making sure all the different parts of your computer, like the screen, keyboard, and mouse, can work together smoothly. It also helps you run programs, which are like tools or appliances in the building. For example, if you want to write a letter or play a game, the operating system helps you open the right program and use it. Different computers might have different operating systems, like Windows, macOS, or Linux, but they all do similar jobs of making your computer easy to use.
